<div class="intro">
Most of us are aware with the word <abbr title="Hypertext markup language"> HTML</abbr>.
Whether you are interested in becoming a professional web developer or you simply want to learn more about how websites work, the first thing you need to study is HTML.
And you know what,Every time you access a website, a server sends an HTML file to your computer and your browser interprets and displays the information included in that file. 
Infact,what you all browse in your day to day lives are html files.
</div>
<strong>
It's very simple to learn.
</strong>
Once we learn html we can proceed further with <i>CSS</i> and <i>JAVASCRIPT.</i>
<p>
<h2>
What is <b>HTML</b>?
</h2>
</p>

<div class="brief">

We all know that HTML refers to hyper text markup language, but what html actually means.<i>Here we go!!</i>
<p>
<b>HyperText</b> refers to text that contains links to other texts.As more and more pages use hypertext to link to each other, a web of pages starts to form. This is where we get the term World Wide Web.
<b>Markup</b> refers to the special symbols or codes that are inserted into a document to tell the web browser how to display the document data.
Like,if we want our text to get bold or italic.
HTML is just one of a number of languages that uses markup code.
<b>Language</b> refers to the idea that the code is standardized. Just like regular spoken languages, there are certain rules that everyone must follow when writing HTML. 
We all know that there are several languages like,python,ruby,java etc and by using them along with html we can create amazing webpages.

<p>
If we put these three definitions together, we could say that HTML is <q>a programming language that uses unique code which allows you to display linked documents in a browser</q>.

<p>
<h2 text=align="center">
Why should we learn <b>HTML</b>?
</h2>
</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\hp\Desktop\Screenshot (14).png" alt="Why to learn html?" title="Reasons to learn html" align="top" />
As you have seen in the above picture , we need to develop ourselves in frontend development inspite of backend development.
</p>
<p>
<h2>
<b>Different versions of HTML.</b>
</h2>
</p>
<p>
The first version of HTML was developed by physicist Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, and the first publicly available version was released in 1991. Since then, HTML has been updated numerous times to address advances in technology.

</p>
<p>
The current standardized version is HTML5, which has been in use since 2014.
</p>
<p>
<h1>
<b>Basic structure of HTML file.</b>
</h1>
</p>
<p>Simple HTML looks in following way</p>
<img src="C:\Users\hp\Desktop\file1.png" alt="Basic html file" title="html file1" width=900px height=500px align="middle" />
<p>
As we have seen in the above figure, for every open tag there should be an ending tag.
</p>
<p>If you are new to you might be thinking what the words in above figure means.So lets look into them in details</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#60;!DOCTYPE html &#62; declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.</li>
<li>The &#60;html &#62; element is the root element of an HTML page
</li>
<li>The &#60;head &#62; element contains meta information about the HTML page</li>
<li>The &#60;title&#62; element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)</li>
<li>The &#60;body&#62; element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you feel better right.</p>
<p>Now you may get a doubt!For every open should there be a closing tag!Yes!!And you will get to know about it in detail further.</p>
So,now let us look into some of the tags to make our webpage look attractive!
<p>We can use headings in our page for attractive look.</p>
Lemme show you an example,
