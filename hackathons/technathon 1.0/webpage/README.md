**Detailed Explanation of the Idea:** It helps to monitor our misplaced items  in our day to day life and makes things easier.

**Solution provided:** Our prototype is well justified with the day to day problem of misplacing things which waste our time in finding them, here we provided an idea as solution to that problem by designing an IOT sensor gps tracker which will be as light weighted as feather.

**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Canva pro(Desiging tool).

**Real Time usage:** This real time projects include IEEE standard-based that produce real-time services. For instance, there are different devices available but they are somewhat not cost effective and their size factor was not upto the mark.So our team decided to make a model whch is cost effective and is  miniature and connect to the android app to discover the lost item.

**Example:** This can be  used to find out the lost items small objects like Rings, Specs, watches or anything you feel it's valuable etc
